# langchain-Agent
Hey there!
I've developed an AI agent designed to help students find scholarship opportunities at San Francisco University. This agent serves students globally who are seeking scholarships at the university. It has access to both public data on San Francisco University scholarships and a Google search tool to retrieve additional information if needed. When it can't directly answer a student's question, it uses the Google search engine to find relevant information.
The agent is highly versatileâ€”ask it anything!
Here's what I used to build the AI agent:
#LangChain: For building the AI-agent
#ASTRA_DB_VectorStore: To store information as embeddings for efficient retrieval.
